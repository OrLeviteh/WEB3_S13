Our initial jump into AWS was super successful. Use the PDF referenced here to go through the process again and get comfortable with AWS. 

What we covered this week:

	• What is a server?
	• What is AWS? What is an Instance?
	• How do I set up a server?
	• Intro to Linux	

Please reach out with any questions or comments. 

Homework: 

	• I will follow up with instructions for minigroup.
	• If you do not have a github account please sign up.
	• Destroy the instance we made in class today and rebuild it (to get comfortable with AWS/Linux)
	• With your new instance publish a simple hello world website using HTML, CSS & Javascript - could be informative, funny or weird.
	• Send me the url to your instance/hello world site
	• Reach out with questions, thoughts or concerns
