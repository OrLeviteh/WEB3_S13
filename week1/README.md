Our initial jump into AWS was super successful. Use the PDF referenced here to go through the process again and get comfortable with AWS. 

What we covered this week:

	• What is a server?
	• What is AWS? What is an Instance?
	• How do I set up a server?

Please reach out with any questions or comments. I will follow up with instructions for minigroup.
